## Overview of the analysis
I want to make the investor invest surf & ice cream shop in Oahu.
To be specific, my goal is to provide W. Avy with insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu where you would like to build your shop. One way to provide this insight is with a visualization—we'll plot the results of our precipitation analysis using Matplotlib.

## Preciption Analysis

2021 times precipitation was observed and the average precipitation amounts for each station for each day is 0.177. During the day, it can be no preciption or have 6.7 precipitation for each station.

## Weather Station Analysis
total 9 stations and find the specific ID and total count for those locations.
W. Avy tells you that he's interested in the most active station.W. Avy is passionate about the location—he's convinced that it will provide the best weather for surfing and eating ice cream. So you tell him that you'll investigate this location further.
The results show that the low (minimum) temperature is 54 degrees, the high (maximum) temperature is 85°F, and the average temperature is approximately 71.7°F for the most active station.

## Overview Challenge Analysis(June & December)
W.Avy wants temperature data for months of June and December in Oahu before opening the surf shop.

## Results
-The average temperature of June and December are very close, and only 74°F-71°F=3°F difference. 
-The min temperature is 64°F and the max temperature is 85°F in June, so the temperature range is 21°F in June.
-The min temperature is 56°F and the max temperature is 83°F in June, so the temperature range is 27°F in June.
